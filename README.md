git clone <repository-url>

```
### Step 2: Install the Database and Import Dummy Data

- Install a **SQL server** (e.g., MySQL Server) and a **DBMS tool** (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
- Create a connection to the SQL server.
- Run the following SQL scripts in order, located in the SQL code folder:
    - semester_project_DDL.sql
    - triggers_events_DML.sql
    - semester_project_inserts_DML.sql

These scripts will create the necessary database structure, triggers, events, and populate the database with dummy data.
